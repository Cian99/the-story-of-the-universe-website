        <p class="textjust">Explain that long ago in ancient times people in every part of the world had a story explaining how everything came to be, and where everything came from, and how people could live meaningful lives.  We call it a Creation Story.  We recommend that the children explore some of these stories as a context for the Universe Story which they will later view in the film.  Below are some examples of Creation Stories.  There can be a very big difference between Creation Stories because the story depended on the part of the planet on which people were living and on the natural world around them.</p>

        <p class="textjust"><b>Story: Silver Fox and Coyote Create the Earth</b></p>
        <p class="textjust"><b>Objective: </b>to help children to understand that all cultures have a Creation Story.</p>
        
        <p class="textjust">
            <span>Back then Silver fox was the only one living. There was no earth, only water.  Silver Fox walked along through the fog, feeling lonely.  So she began to sing:</span><br>
            <span class="tfox">I want to meet someone, I want to meet someone, I want to meet someone.</span><br>
            <span>So she sang and then she met Coyote.</span><br>
            <span class="tfox">“I thought I was going to meet someone.” </span><span>Silver Fox said:</span><span class="tfox"> “Where are you travelling?”</span><br>
            <span class="tcoyote">“Where are you travelling” </span><span>Coyote said:</span><span class="tcoyote"> “Why are you travelling like this?”</span><br>
            <span class="tfox">“I am travelling because I am lonely,</span><span>  Silver Fox said.</span><br>
            <span class="tcoyote">“I am also wandering around.”</span><span> Said Coyote.</span><br>
            <span class="tfox">“Then it is better for two people to travel together.”</span><span> Silver Fox said.</span><br>
            <span>Then as they travelled, Silver Fox spoke:  <span class="tfox">“This is what I think”,</span><span> Silver Fox said:</span><span class="tfox"> “Let’s make the world”.</span><br>
            <span class="tcoyote">“How will we do that”?</span><span> Coyote said.</span><br>
            <span class="tfox">“We will sing the world”,</span><span> said silver Fox.  </span><br>
            <span>So the two of them began to sing and to dance.  They danced around in a circle and Silver Fox thought of a clump of sod.  Let it come, Silver Fox thought, and then that clump of sod was there in Silver Fox’s hands.  Silver Fox threw it down into the fog and they kept on singing and dancing.  </span><br>
            <span class="tfox">“Look down”</span><span> Silver Fox said,</span><span class="tfox"> “Do you see something there below us?”</span><br>
            <span class="tcoyote">“I see something.”</span><span> Coyote said,”</span><span class="tcoyote"> But it is very small.”</span><br>
            <span class="tfox">“Then let us close our eyes and keep dancing and singing.”</span><span> said Silver Fox. And that was what they did. They danced and sang and beneath them Earth took shape.</span><br>
            <span class="tfox">“Look down now.”</span><span> Silver Fox said</span><br>
            <span>Coyote looked down. <span class="tcoyote">“I see it.”</span><span> said Coyote.</span><span class="tcoyote"> “It is very big now.  It is big enough.” </span><br>
            <span>Then the two of them jumped down onto Earth.  They danced and sang and stretched it out even more.  They made everything on Earth, the valleys and the mountains and the rivers and the lakes, the trees and the birds and the animal people. That was what they did way back then.</span><br>

        <p class="textjust"><b>Questions:</b><br>
            <b>1.</b>	What did the Yosemite Miwok people believe about how everything came to be? Where did they believe Earth came from?<br>
            <b>2.</b>	Why do you think people thought that Fox and Coyote created Earth. (The children will have their answers.  Eventually one may need to explain that in ancient times that people only knew about the part of the Earth in which they lived. So what did they know and experience.  Basically  the world of nature around them - animals, insects, plants, the Sun coming and going daily and seasonally etc.  They must have seen the Fox and the Coyote as being special and even magical.)<br>
            <b>3.</b>	How do you think the Yosemite Miwoks might have treated animals and nature in general?<br>
            <b>4.</b>	Does the story say how humans came? (Leading to a discussion about humans belonging to the animal world)<br>
            <b>5.</b>	Do you like the Yosemite Miwok Creation Story? Why? Why not?</p>

        <h2 style="color: palevioletred">The T’Boli Creation Story</h2>
        
        <p class="text"><i>The T’Boli are an indigenous people living in the Philippine Islands.</i></p>

        <p class="textjust">In the beginning there were no mountains on earth.  Water spread out in all directions.  D’wata, the spirit, said: “I will create land for all the creatures so that they will have a place to live.”  D’wata asked the hawk to find soil, but he failed.  The dove was asked, but she too failed.  Then D’wata asked the Betoti, a small swift-flying bird.  The Betoti was lucky and within 8 days found soil.  D’wata said: “We will spread the soil so the waters can recede.  Each place you hop will be dry land.”<br>For 8 days and nights the Betoti hopped until half the world was covered with land.  All the animals moved on to the land and began to live there.  After a while one of the animals suggested to Betoti that they should have someone to look after them.  Then Betoti formed 16 clay statues, eight male and eight female.  After 8 days one of the male statues moved.  After another 8 days he spoke and said: “What a privilege it is to be called to care for the Earth and Sky.”  Then the man thought: “I must look for a suitable companion.” At that very moment a female statue moved and she became man’s partner.</p>

        <p class="text"><i>Having again discussed the concept of Creation Story ,ask the children if we have a Creation Story here in Ireland.  What do we believe about who created the world and where everything comes from? There may  be children from other  cultures in the class who might like to answer the question about what they believe about where everything comes from.  Teacher reads the story.</i></p>
        
        <p class="textjust">In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth.  God said: "Let there be light!"  And God saw the light was good.  God separated the light from the darkness.  He called the light Day and the darkness night.  God saw day and night and said: “That is Good.”</p>
        <p class="textjust">That was the First Day</p>
        <p class="textjust">The next day God said: “Let us make the waters.  God saw that was good. Then he made the Sky over the Earth.  Then God saw all that and said “That is Good”.</p>
        <p class="textjust">That was the Second Day</p>
        <p class="textjust">The next day God said: “Let the waters of the Earth be gathered together in one place and let the dry land appear.” God called the dry land Earth and the waters gathered together he called Seas.  God saw that this was good.  The he said let the Earth bring to birth a great variety of plants and trees with their seeds. God saw all He had made that day and said: “That is Good” </p>
        <p class="textjust">That was the Third Day</p>
        <p class="textjust">The next day God said: “Let us make the Sun to give great light to the day and the Moon to give lesser light at night and they will make the seasons of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.  God also made the Stars.” God saw all he had created and said: “That is Good”  </p>
        <p class="textjust">That was the Fourth Day</p>
        <p class="textjust">The next day God said: Let the waters give birth to fish of all kinds, big and small. Then he created the birds of the air, very big birds and smaller birds. When God saw all the fish in the ocean and all the birds soaring in the skies he said: “That is Good” </p>
        <p class="textjust">That was the Fifth Day</p>
        <p class="textjust">On the next day God said: “Let us make all kinds of animals and insects to live on the land – foxes, bears, badgers, lions, hares, rabbits, bees, ants, beetles and butterflies.”  Then at the end he said: “Let us make humans, woman and man.”  He gave them charge over all the Earth and everything in it, to take care of it.  God saw all that he had made that day and said: “That is Good.”</p>
        <p class="textjust">That was the Sixth Day</p>
        <p class="textjust">The next day God looked at all he had made and said this is a holy day because it is a day of rest. </p>
        <p class="textjust">That was the Seventh Day: Sunday - The Holy Day of Rest</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textjust"><b>Questions:</b><br>
            <b>1.</b>	What do Christians believe about the origins of everything, where everything came from? (Suggesting a discussion about God as Creator. When it comes to the narrative in the Universe Story film God is not intentionally omitted.  The awesomeness of the story evokes a spiritual response.  Each tradition brings its own beliefs to the scientific discovery of the origins and story of the Universe.  The Universe Story does not replace the traditional creation stories and it can be said that it enhances them)  <br>
            <b>2.</b>	What does God say about the Earth, Water, Animals, Plants, Insects, Birds? ( The question will evoke the reply that everything is good.  Do we humans see all the animals, insects, land, water and all of nature as good and beautiful?)<br>
            <b>3.</b>	Did God say something about us humans that was different from what he said about everything else? (The question suggests a discussion about our relationship with the rest of nature and about our responsibilities.)<br>
            <b>4.</b>	What is the meaning of the 7th Day? (Suggesting a discussion on Sunday in the Christian tradition as a Holy Day of rest and enjoyment of the natural world)  <br>
            <b>5.</b>	What is the difference between this story and the Miwok and T’bolii story? <br>
