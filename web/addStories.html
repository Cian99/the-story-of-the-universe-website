        <p class="textjust">One time not too long ago, there was a little three-year-old boy called Jayden who lived with his parents in Chicago in the United States of America.  Generally, he was a well-behaved little boy.
            One day his parents decided to take him to the Zoo not far from their home. They had an enjoyable visit
            and it was nearing the end when the little boy, taking advantage of the fact that his parents were
            not watching closely, climbed on a railing and fell two stories down into a gorilla pen. He hit his head, had a broken arm, a gash on his face and was unconscious. As he lay there injured, a young gorilla mother called Binti picked up the little boy Jayden and cradled him in her arms. She then carried him to the door of the pen and gently laid him where the zoo keepers could rescue him. He was taken to hospital, still unconscious. After four days he woke up and slowly recovered to full health.
            Binti is now known as the compassionate gorilla, and people come to the Zoo especially to see her.

            <b>3.</b>	Have you any experience of animals expressing feelings?<br>

        <p class="textjust">You will find 3 kinds of Swans in Ireland ‚Äì The Mute Swan, the Whooper Swan and the Bewick Swan.
            The Bewick Swan and the Whooper are migrant ‚Äì They come here for part of the year.  
            There is a lovely story about a pair of Bewick Swans who were travelling back to Arctic Siberia. Somebody named them Snowflake the male, and Rainbow the female.  They stopped off for a night on a lake.  During the night the lake froze over and Rainbow got stuck in the ice and was not able to free herself.  Snowflake was able to free himself but he would not leave his female partner.  After a few days she was rescued, but by then she was sick and weak.  It took a month to nurse her back to full health.  Snowflake stayed nearby in the icy river, waiting for his mate.  When finally Rainbow was well enough to fly, the pair greeted each other happily and flew north.
